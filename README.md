# Simple-Mini-Game

This repository contains the work done by Sadhana (EC22185) and Rohan (EC) as part of MSc Coursework in Advanced game development.

In the course, we learnt C++ coding best practices with using Smart pointers, how to organise our code and how to organise the #include libraries. We were guided through the base implementation of a game in Object oriented programming and then transforming that code into Data Driven Programming following Game programming patterns which were taught in the theory component of the class.

The detailed instructions which were followed to complete the assignment have been added to the Assignment Instructions folder. 
As an overview
	* We were given a bunch of helper code and a base platform to start our project on
	* The first assignment entails understanding the code which was given and making a sprite move around randomly in the generated window.
	* In the second assignment, We then went on to create a simple game in Object oriented programming having all the features planned in place.
	* In the third assignment, We took the game and reorganised the code to follow Entity Component architecture
	* In the fourth assignment, We took it a step further and made it in the Big array version of Entity Component System architecture


	* In the final assignment, which was also the main submission for our course, We were tasked with the implementation of as many Game programming patterns as we could for this game. We split up the tasks and implemented every pattern except the sparse Array pattern.

The first three assignments were done together working on the same PC during our lab sessions and after class hours. Post that we had split up the work and worked on it seperately creating branches in GIT ( It is in our QMUL enterprise account )
I had taken the lead on Implementing,
	* Graphics Systems
	* Logic Systems
	* Movement systems
	* ECS architectures
	* Object pool pattern
	* Flyweight pattern
